## Data Science

I'm an aspiring data scientist who excels at data visualizations with some experience in statistical modeling, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.

I interned at Fred Hutch in 2021 under Doctor Brian Williamson in infectious disease research.  While there I used R to run [statistical modeling experiments](/sl_screens/) and create data visualizations for a simulation created by Doctor Williamson.

## Software Engineering

In summer 2022 I helped build a mental health app called [Solala](https://solala.app).  I am a junior programmer and a research lead.  You can read more about my role [here](https://solala.app/drew.html).  My goal is to obtain an internship for Summer 2023 and get involved with research and big data during the next academic calendar year.

## Education

Currently, I am a [Computer Science](/allen_school/) undergraduate student at UW Seattle with an expected graduation date of Fall 2024.  I completed my associates degree from Seattle Central College in Applied Sciences and Physics in June 2021.

## Hobbies

In my free time I volunteer on the Community Action Board at [Ability](https://ability.cs.washington.edu) as their Student Relations Officer, I am an avid cityscape explorer, and I cat sit for my family on the peninsula.

My passion is taking on real world problems by wrangling data into meaningful solutions.
