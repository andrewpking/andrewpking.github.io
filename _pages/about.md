I'm a junior data scientist who excels at data visualizations with some experience in machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.

I interned at Fred Hutch in 2021 under Doctor Brian Williamson in infectious disease research.  While there I used R to run machine learning experiments and create data visualizations for a simulation created by Doctor Williamson.

Currently, I am a Computer Science undergraduate student at UW Seattle with an expected graduation date of Spring 2024.  I completed my associates degree from Seattle Central College in Applied Sciences and Physics in June 2021.

In my free time I volunteer on the Community Action Board at the Fred Hutch HIV Vaccine trial, I am an avid cityscape explorer, and I cat sit for my family on the peninsula.
