## Research Findings

### Investigating the use of screens in Super Learner ensembles

This section presents research conducted by Andrew King, Brian Williamson, PhD, and Ying Huang, PhD. The research focuses on the use of screens in Super Learner ensembles, particularly in the context of biomedical research. The findings highlight the challenges posed by the large number of variables in clinical trials data and the potential of machine learning ensembles to improve performance. Notably, the research concludes that combining Super Learner with screens or Lasso and screens is a safe choice, while using Lasso alone or Lasso with Super Learner without screens is unreliable.

### Results

The section further elaborates on the unexpected results obtained from the research, emphasizing the importance of combining specific procedures for optimal performance. The code related to this research will be made available on GitHub once the paper is published, and it will be open source under the MIT license.

## Projects

### Allen School Biography

This section provides insights into the academic journey of Andrew King, a senior Computer Science student at the University of Washington. The content highlights the application of meta-cognitive skills, networking, and the use of Cornell Notes in the context of studying and teaching computer science.

### Solala App

The "Solala App" section showcases the development of a data-driven Mental Health Application using Node.js on Azure. The project involves contributions from Lee Janzen, Christopher Roy, Christoph Bendix, and Drew King. The abstract of the project outlines the challenges faced by current mental health apps and introduces the goals of the Solala app. The app's design, features, and impact on mental health research are discussed, and the project's repository is provided for further exploration.
