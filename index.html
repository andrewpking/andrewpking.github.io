<p>I'm a junior data scientist who excels at data visualizations with some experience in machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.</p>

<p>I interned at Fred Hutch in 2021 under Doctor Brian Williamson in infectious disease research.  While there I used R to run [machine learning experiments](/sl_screens.md) and create data visualizations for a simulation created by Doctor Williamson.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a <a href="/allen_school/">Computer Science</a> undergraduate student at UW Seattle with an expected graduation date of Spring 2024.  I completed my associates degree from Seattle Central College in Applied Sciences and Physics in June 2021.</p>

<p>This summer I am helping build a mental health app called <a href="https://solala.app">Solala</a>.  I am a junior programmer and a research lead.  You can read more about my role <a href="/solala/">here</a>.  My goal is to obtain an internship for Summer 2023 and get involved with research and big data during the next academic calendar year.  </p>

<p>In my free time I volunteer on the Community Action Board at the <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/immunology-and-vaccine-development/seattle-vaccine-trials-unit.html">Fred Hutch HIV Vaccine trial</a>, I am an avid cityscape explorer, and I cat sit for my family on the peninsula.</p>

<p>My passion is taking on real world problems by wrangling data into meaningful solutions. </p>
