I'm a junior data scientist who excels at data visualizations with some experience in machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.

I interned at Fred Hutch in 2021 under Doctor Brian Williamson in infectious disease research.  While there I used R to run [machine learning experiments](/sl_screens.md) and create data visualizations for a simulation created by Doctor Williamson.

Currently, I am a [Computer Science](/allen-school.md) undergraduate student at UW Seattle with an expected graduation date of Spring 2024.  I completed my associates degree from Seattle Central College in Applied Sciences and Physics in June 2021.

This summer I am helping build a mental health app called [Solala](https://solala.app).  I am a junior programmer and a research lead.  You can read more about my role [here](/solala.md).  My goal is to obtain an internship for Summer 2023 and get involved with research and big data during the next academic calendar year.  

In my free time I volunteer on the Community Action Board at the [Fred Hutch HIV Vaccine trial](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/immunology-and-vaccine-development/seattle-vaccine-trials-unit.html), I am an avid cityscape explorer, and I cat sit for my family on the peninsula.

My passion is taking on real world problems by wrangling data into meaningful solutions.
