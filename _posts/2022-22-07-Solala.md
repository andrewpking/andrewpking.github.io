# Building a data driven Mental Health Application that using Node.js on Azure

## Lee Janzen; Christopher Roy; Christoph Bendix; and Drew King

### University of Washington

Abstract

Current mental health apps fail in several manners
* User retention, 80% of users uninstall after first month
* Large number of participants = good
* Attrition -> challenging
Mental health app design that increases retention and has meaningful results.
* Target audience: users experiencing depression, anxiety, work/school stress
* Designed using research on app retention
* Can identify emotional state of user
* Offers activities proven to reduce stress
* Issue: varying needs of users
Potential solution: use machine learning algorithms to identify emotion states
* Combine results across procedures
* Allows enhanced flexibility
* Issue: no formal guidelines for combining certain procedures
Goal: establish guidelines around ensemble procedures
Potential impact in mental health research and real world impact on app users.


*Methodology of this research will be available upon app publication, see more details at [solala.app](solala.app)*


Results

Solala is an app designed by students with the intention of improving the mental health of burned out professionals and students.
* Built with universal design and accessibility principles in mind
* UX Design process considers the needs of colorblind individuals
* Additionally the design process considers user retention through gamification
Users will care for a plant that grows with them
* The plant is intended to motivate users to take care of themselves and complete growth tasks
* Plant encourages users to drink water, meditate, and take breaks
This work is backed by research into wellness and mental health for individuals under high stress.

*Code will be available on GitHub once the app is live*

**Next steps:**
Conduct further research from consenting users including:
* User retention for Solala based on reward intervals and task intervals
* Testing other algorithms that process emotion state data.
* Building this experiment in mobile native languages such as
Darwin or Swift for better performance.

Following publication, results will be replicable by others with scientific computing tools
